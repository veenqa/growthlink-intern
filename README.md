This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species (setosa , versicolor , virginica ) using machine learning. Key objectives include:

1.Data Exploration :
 . Analyze the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions and correlations.
 . Identify significant features using statistical methods (e.g., ANOVA F-value).

2.Model Development :
  . Train and evaluate multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
  . Optimize model performance through feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

3.Performance Evaluation :
  . Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  . Visualize results via confusion matrices and classification reports.

4.Deployment Readiness :
  . Save the best-performing model for future inference.
  . Organize outputs (models, reports) for reproducibility.
